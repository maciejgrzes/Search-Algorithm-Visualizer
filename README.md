To run this program, the PyGame module needs to be installed as well as pygame_gui.
than simply run "python main.py" in terminal.

When you press "Solve Maze" twice on the same maze without generating a new one it throws an error, yeah i know im just not bothered enough to fix that for now ;)

Also feel free to use this code in your own projects
